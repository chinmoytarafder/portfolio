            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                SkyHunter addresses the critical need for a cost-effective, high-performance homeland defense interceptor
                to counter diverse airborne threats. Designed for rapid response and maneuverability, it balances advanced
                capabilities with affordability, ensuring the protection of U.S. airspace against evolving threats.

            <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
            <p>
                The SkyHunter features a single-engine configuration to reduce cost and complexity while maintaining
                operational efficiency. Its aerodynamic design includes a swept-wing layout with high-lift devices, twin
                vertical stabilizers for enhanced control, and optimized fuel storage to ensure stability and maneuverability.

            <h3>Trade Studies</h3>
            <p>
                Extensive trade studies compared remote-operated and manned configurations, engine options, and single
                versus twin-engine designs. Remote operation was favored for its superior maneuverability and reduced
                cost. The single-engine setup, powered by the GE F110-129, was chosen for its balance of performance
                and affordability.
