            <h3>Design and Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The aircraft was meticulously designed using CAD tools like SolidWorks, enabling the creation of
                custom components tailored for optimized performance. Key design features included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A custom motor mount to securely hold the motor in place.</li>
                <li>Landing gear and wheels designed for durability and smooth takeoff and landing operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and AVL (Athena Vortex Lattice) simulations were conducted to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify aerodynamic efficiency of the design.</li>
                <li>Ensure flight stability under various operating conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <li>A high-efficiency motor for reliable propulsion.</li>
                <li>Servos for precise control of flight surfaces.</li>
                <li>An RC system to ensure stable communication during flight.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Testing and Results</h3>
            <p>
                The RC airplane underwent successful flight tests, demonstrating:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stable flight performance under various conditions.</li>
                <li>Precise maneuverability, validating the design and control systems.</li>
